AWS EC2 Web Server Deployment
This project provides a step-by-step guide to deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance using Linux (Amazon Linux 2).

Steps
1. Launch an EC2 Instance
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
Click on "Launch Instance" to begin the instance creation process.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Select Amazon Linux 2.
Select an Instance Type: Choose a suitable instance type (e.g. t2.micro for Free Tier).
Configure Instance Details, Add Storage, Add Tags, and Configure Security Group as needed. Ensure port 80 (HTTP) is open in the security group.
Review your instance configuration and click "Launch".
Select an existing key pair or create a new one, and then launch your instance.
2. Connect to Your EC2 Instance
Once your instance is running, select it from the EC2 dashboard.
Click on "Connect" to get instructions on how to connect to your instance using SSH.
3. Install and Configure Apache Web Server
Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
Update the package repository: sudo yum update -y.
Install Apache web server: sudo yum install httpd -y.
Start the Apache service: sudo systemctl start httpd.
Enable Apache to start on boot: sudo systemctl enable httpd.
4. Test Your Web Server
Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP address(13.233.27.125). You should see the Apache default page indicating your web server is running.
5. Deploy Your Website
Upload your website files to the default document root directory: sudo cp -r /path/to/your/website/* /var/www/html/.
Restart Apache for the changes to take effect: sudo systemctl restart httpd.
6. Monitor and Maintain Your Web Server
Regularly monitor your web server's performance and security.
Keep your server and web applications updated with the latest patches.
Conclusion
Congratulations! I have successfully deployed a web server on an EC2 instance using Linux.
