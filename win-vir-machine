AWS Mini Project: Deploying a Windows Virtual Machine
Objective: Deploy a Windows virtual machine (VM)/Instance on AWS EC2.

Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console
Open your web browser and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
Sign in with your AWS account credentials.
Step 2: Launch EC2 Instance
Navigate to the EC2 service dashboard.
Click on "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation process.
Follow the on-screen instructions:
Choose an AMI: Select a Windows Server AMI, preferably one eligible for the Free Tier.
Select Instance Type: Choose an instance type, such as t2.micro(free tier).
Configure Instance: Keep default settings or customize as needed (e.g., network settings, IAM roles).
Add Storage: Configure storage options.
Add Tags: (Optional) Add tags for easy identification.
Configure Security Group: Ensure RDP (port 3389) is allowed in the security group.
Review and Launch: Review your instance configuration and launch the instance.
Step 3: Connect to Your Windows Virtual Machine.
Once the instance is running, select it from the EC2 dashboard.
Click on "Connect" and choose "RDP client" to download the Remote Desktop File.
Open the Remote Desktop client on your local machine (Windows Remote Desktop or any RDP client for macOS).
Use the downloaded Remote Desktop File to connect to your Windows VM using the public IP address.
Enter the username (usually Administrator) and password. You can retrieve the password from the instance details by decrypting the key pair file.
Step 4: Configure Your Windows VM
Upon successful connection, you'll be logged into your Windows VM.
Customize your VM settings, install applications, and configure services as needed.
Ensure to apply security best practices and keep your VM updated with the latest patches.
Step 5: Explore EC2 Instance Details
Return to the EC2 dashboard and select your instance.
Explore various details such as instance ID, public IP, private IP, security groups, monitoring metrics, etc.
Familiarize yourself with instance management options like stopping, starting, and terminating instances.
Step 6: Cleanup
Once you've finished experimenting, stop or terminate your EC2 instance to avoid ongoing charges.
Optionally, delete associated resources like key pairs, security groups, and EBS volumes if they're no longer needed.
Conclusion
By completing this project, I have gained hands-on experience deploying a Windows VM on AWS EC2, connecting to it using RDP, and exploring essential instance management tasks. This project provides a solid foundation for further exploration and learning in AWS cloud computing.
